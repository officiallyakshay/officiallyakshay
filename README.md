Full-stack engineer with a product mindset. I build fast, think like a user, and ship clean, intuitive interfaces, end to end.

I mainly work with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and a mix of databases. Lately, exploring AI through side projects.

I’m looking for high-ownership roles where I can move fast, shape real products, and work with sharp, driven teams.

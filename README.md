I'm a senior software engineer with a product mindset. I move fast, think like a user, and ship products that are simple, intuitive, and impactful end to end.

I focus on real customer problems, shaping roadmaps, and driving outcomes, leveraging my engineering experience (TypeScript, React, Node.js, databases) to bridge vision with execution.

I’m looking for high-ownership roles where I can shape direction, drive impact, and work with sharp, driven teams.
